## About
Treasure Defense is a strategic defense game I designed and developed with the aim of demonstrating a single core dynamic through fluid tutorialization.

## Strategic Defense
Games that revolve around strategic defense as their core dynamic require the player to think and act strategically in real-time, managing multiple threats and prioritizing actions to protect critical assets. In Treasure Defense, this is demonstrated through a unique balance of defending the treasure and self-preservation.
